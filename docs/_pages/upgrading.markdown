## Reminders
- Please be sure to **backup** your TRIRIGA instance prior to any changes
- Be aware that your Assistant will take time to provision and upgrade


### Step 1 - OM Package Import

1.	Create new Object Migration import package selecting [the tri-assistant-*.zip file]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/tree/master/om-package) provided in the om-package folder.
2.	Validate and Import the new OM package.


### Step 2 - Clear ClassLoader Cache

We have found that any new ClassLoader imported through OM import doesn't always get used by the Provisioning Form.  To make sure this happens, we ask that you flush the "Custom ClassLoader Data" cache using the following steps.

1. From the System Administration UI, choose `Caches`.
2. Click on `Custom ClassLoader Data`.


### Step 3 - Submit the Provisioning Request

1. From the TRIRIGA Main Page, click on My Reports > System Reports, and filter on the Business Object column for `ibmAssistantProvisionOrder`.
2. Execute the `TRIRIGA Assistant Provision Record Query`.
3. Select the record found (there should be only one) and Click `Delete` to remove the old record. 
4. Click `Add` to create a new record.
5. Enter the URL for your TRIRIGA instance. Note: The instance must be accessible without a VPN and through HTTPS. Include the complete path, starting with `https://`.
6. Enter the user name and password for the assistant account you created earlier.
7. Enter your name and email address so we can contact you when the assistant services have been provisioned for your instance.
8. Click Submit.


### Step 4 - Wait for contact from a IBM TRIRIGA Assistant team member

Once the information has been successfully received by the IBM TRIRIGA Assistant services, an IBM TRIRIGA Assistant team member will upgrade the Watson Assistant skill.  Once complete, you will be contacted through email at the email address provided on the form with further instructions if needed.  If you do not receive a response from IBM in a week, please contact your IBM representative.
